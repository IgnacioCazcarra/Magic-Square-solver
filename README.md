# Magic-Square-solver
This project solves 3x3 magic squares using backtracking. 
It was a bit challenging since it is a little bit harder than the sudoku solver. 

IMPORTANT:
-If you set an impossible initial matrix as in the example below, the result wont show at all.
Example of an impossible answer:
2 0 6
1 0 0
0 0 8
 
-If you leave an empty matrix such as: 
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
the function will return all posible solutions
